# Sentiment Analysis for Book Text - System Design

## Overview

The "Sentiment Analysis for Book Text" project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a given book's text using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The project involves text processing, sentiment scoring, and visualization of sentiment distribution within the book's chapters.

## Architecture

The project follows a straightforward architecture involving text processing, sentiment analysis, and result visualization. Here's how the system components interact:

1. **Input:**
   - The book text is provided as a text file named "miracle_in_the_andes.txt."

2. **Text Processing:**
   - The Python script reads the book text from the file and applies regular expressions to extract words.
   - The extracted words are counted to determine their occurrences in the text.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is used to calculate sentiment scores for the entire book and individual chapters.
   - The sentiment scores are computed based on positive, negative, and neutral sentiment.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - The sentiment scores for each chapter are displayed, indicating the emotional tone of each chapter.
   - Chapters with the most positive and negative sentiments are identified.

## Components

1. **Input:**
   - "miracle_in_the_andes.txt": The text file containing the book's content.

2. **Text Processing:**
   - Regular expressions are used to extract words from the book text.
   - Word occurrences are counted to create a frequency distribution.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is employed to compute sentiment scores.
   - Sentiment scores represent the emotional polarity of the book and its chapters.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - The Python script displays sentiment scores for each chapter.
   - Positive, negative, and neutral sentiment categories are identified.
   - Chapters with extreme positive and negative sentiments are highlighted.

## Advantages

- Provides insights into the emotional journey of the book.
- Identifies chapters with significant positive or negative sentiment.
- Demonstrates the use of NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer for text analysis.
- Offers a practical application of sentiment analysis in the context of literature.

## Conclusion

The "Sentiment Analysis for Book Text" project showcases the application of sentiment analysis techniques using NLTK in Python. By processing the book's text, calculating sentiment scores, and visualizing the results, the project provides valuable insights into the emotional content of different chapters. This system design highlights the simplicity and effectiveness of the architecture for analyzing sentiment within text data.
